# Rewind file changes with checkpointing

Track file changes during agent sessions and restore files to any previous state

---

File checkpointing tracks file modifications made through the Write, Edit, and NotebookEdit tools during an agent session, allowing you to rewind files to any previous state.

With checkpointing, you can:

- **Undo unwanted changes** by restoring files to a known good state
- **Explore alternatives** by restoring to a checkpoint and trying a different approach
- **Recover from errors** when the agent makes incorrect modifications

**Warning**: Only changes made through the Write, Edit, and NotebookEdit tools are tracked. Changes made through Bash commands (like `echo > file.txt` or `sed -i`) are not captured by the checkpoint system.

## How checkpointing works

When you enable file checkpointing, the SDK creates backups of files before modifying them. User messages in the response stream include a checkpoint UUID that you can use as a restore point.

**Note**: File rewinding restores files on disk to a previous state. It does not rewind the conversation itself. The conversation history and context remain intact after calling `rewindFiles()` (TypeScript) or `rewind_files()` (Python).

## Implement checkpointing

```python Python
import asyncio
import os
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions, UserMessage, ResultMessage

async def main():
    # Step 1: Enable checkpointing
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        enable_file_checkpointing=True,
        permission_mode="acceptEdits",
        extra_args={"replay-user-messages": None},
        env={**os.environ, "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_SDK_FILE_CHECKPOINTING": "1"}
    )

    checkpoint_id = None
    session_id = None

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options) as client:
        await client.query("Refactor the authentication module")

        # Step 2: Capture checkpoint UUID from the first user message
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if isinstance(message, UserMessage) and message.uuid and not checkpoint_id:
                checkpoint_id = message.uuid
            if isinstance(message, ResultMessage) and not session_id:
                session_id = message.session_id

    # Step 3: Later, rewind by resuming the session with an empty prompt
    if checkpoint_id and session_id:
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(ClaudeAgentOptions(
            enable_file_checkpointing=True,
            resume=session_id
        )) as client:
            await client.query("")
            async for message in client.receive_response():
                await client.rewind_files(checkpoint_id)
                break
        print(f"Rewound to checkpoint: {checkpoint_id}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

async function main() {
  const opts = {
    enableFileCheckpointing: true,
    permissionMode: "acceptEdits" as const,
    extraArgs: { 'replay-user-messages': null },
    env: { ...process.env, CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_SDK_FILE_CHECKPOINTING: '1' }
  };

  const response = query({
    prompt: "Refactor the authentication module",
    options: opts
  });

  let checkpointId: string | undefined;
  let sessionId: string | undefined;

  for await (const message of response) {
    if (message.type === 'user' && message.uuid && !checkpointId) {
      checkpointId = message.uuid;
    }
    if ('session_id' in message && !sessionId) {
      sessionId = message.session_id;
    }
  }

  // Later, rewind by resuming the session with an empty prompt
  if (checkpointId && sessionId) {
    const rewindQuery = query({
      prompt: "",
      options: { ...opts, resume: sessionId }
    });

    for await (const msg of rewindQuery) {
      await rewindQuery.rewindFiles(checkpointId);
      break;
    }
    console.log(`Rewound to checkpoint: ${checkpointId}`);
  }
}

main();
```

## Configuration options

| Option | Python | TypeScript | Description |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Enable checkpointing | `enable_file_checkpointing=True` | `enableFileCheckpointing: true` | Tracks file changes for rewinding |
| Receive checkpoint UUIDs | `extra_args={"replay-user-messages": None}` | `extraArgs: { 'replay-user-messages': null }` | Required to get user message UUIDs in the stream |

## Common patterns

### Checkpoint before risky operations

Keep only the most recent checkpoint UUID, updating it before each agent turn:

```python Python
safe_checkpoint = None

async for message in client.receive_response():
    if isinstance(message, UserMessage) and message.uuid:
        safe_checkpoint = message.uuid

    if your_revert_condition and safe_checkpoint:
        await client.rewind_files(safe_checkpoint)
        break
```

### Multiple restore points

Store all checkpoint UUIDs in an array with metadata:

```python Python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class Checkpoint:
    id: str
    description: str
    timestamp: datetime

checkpoints = []

async for message in client.receive_response():
    if isinstance(message, UserMessage) and message.uuid:
        checkpoints.append(Checkpoint(
            id=message.uuid,
            description=f"After turn {len(checkpoints) + 1}",
            timestamp=datetime.now()
        ))
```

## Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Write/Edit/NotebookEdit tools only | Changes made through Bash commands are not tracked |
| Same session | Checkpoints are tied to the session that created them |
| File content only | Creating, moving, or deleting directories is not undone by rewinding |
| Local files | Remote or network files are not tracked |
